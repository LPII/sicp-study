h1. Worked Examples for SICP

This is my worked examples for the "SICP book":http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html.  The work is divided up into weekly studies, based around the "video lectures":http://www.archive.org/details/mit_ocw_sicp.

h2. Coding Examples

h3. Scheme Examples

You will find the worked examples in Scheme in the scheme directory of this project.  Each week's work will be its own directory.  Examples will be named ex<em>m_n</em>.scm (where <em>m_n</em> is exercise number _m.n_).  The book_code.scm will contain any interesting code snippets from the book in the assigned reading for that week.

Have fun.

h3. Clojure Examples

Some Clojure examples can be found in the clojure directory.  They are a bit less organized that the Scheme examples, but feel free to peruse them.  Perhaps something will be useful to you.

h2. Schedule

You will find the weekly assignments "here":http://groups.google.com/group/wizardbookstudy/web/weekly-assignments?hl=en.
