h1. Worked Examples for SICP

This is my worked examples for the "SICP book":http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html.  The work is divided up into weekly studies, based around the "video lectures":http://www.archive.org/details/mit_ocw_sicp.

You will find the worked examples in Scheme in the scheme directory of this project.  Each week's work will be its own directory.  Examples will be named ex<em>m_n</em>.scm (where <em>m_n</em> is exercise number _m.n_).  The book_code.scm will contain any interesting code snippets from the book in the assigned reading for that week.

Have fun.
