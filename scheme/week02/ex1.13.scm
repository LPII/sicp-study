;; Exercise 1.13:
;;
;; Prove that Fib(n) is the closest integer to (phi**n)/sqrt(5), where
;; phi= (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Hint: Let psi = (1 - sqrt(5))/2. Use
;; induction and the definition of the Fibonacci numbers (see section
;; 1.2.2) to prove that Fib(n) = (phi**n - psi**n)/sqrt(5).

;; HA!  I'm not even going to try to solve this myself.  A good
;; explanation of this proof can be found at:
